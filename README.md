## Dad as a service (Windows Presentation Foundation version)

This is a code challenge based on the following:

---
> Create an application using C#, .NET, and optionally ASP.NET that uses the I
> [I can haz dad joke api](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) 
> to display jokes. 
> You are welcome to use more technologies like Angular if you wish but it's not required.
> 
> There should be two modes the user can choose between:
> 
> 1. Display a random joke every 10 seconds.
> 2. Accept a search term and display the first 30 jokes containing that term, 
>   with the matching term emphasized in some way (upper, bold, color, etc.) 
>   and the matching jokes grouped by length: short (<10 words), medium (<20 words), long (>= 20 words).
